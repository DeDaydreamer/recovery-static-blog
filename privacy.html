        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 09 December 2025</p>

        <p>
          The Daydreamverse Blog is a personal publishing project run by me, Aleks D. It is a simple,
          static website where I write about addiction, recovery, neurobiology, harm reduction,
          prevention, and rebuilding a life. This page explains what personal data is collected when
          you visit this site or interact with me, and how I handle it.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Who is responsible for this site?</h2>
          <p>
            The Daydreamverse Blog is created and maintained by Aleks Dubowski as a personal project,
            connected with my broader creative and AI studio, DeDynamics.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have questions about privacy on this site, you can contact me via the
            <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. What kind of data I collect</h2>
          <p>
            This site is intentionally minimal. I only collect the information that is necessary for
            basic functionality and communication:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Newsletter subscriptions:</strong> If you subscribe to the newsletter, you provide
              your email address and optionally your name. This data is used only to send you newsletter
              emails or important updates related to The Daydreamverse Blog.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contact messages:</strong> If you contact me via a form or by email, I receive the
              information you choose to send (such as your name, email address, and message content).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Server and security logs:</strong> Like most websites, infrastructure providers may
              automatically collect technical information such as IP address, browser type, device
              information, and timestamps for security, performance, and abuse prevention.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. How I use your data</h2>
          <p>I use the data mentioned above only for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To send you emails you explicitly subscribed to (newsletter or similar updates).</li>
            <li>To reply to messages you send through contact forms or directly by email.</li>
            <li>To keep the site secure and running reliably (for example, monitoring abuse or errors).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I do not sell your personal data and I do not use it for advertising profiling.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Services and processors I rely on</h2>
          <p>
            The Daydreamverse Blog is hosted and delivered via third-party infrastructure. This means
            some personal data is technically processed by these providers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cloudflare:</strong> Used for hosting, DNS, and content delivery. They may process
              technical data such as IP addresses and request metadata for security and performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resend:</strong> Used to send newsletter emails. When you subscribe, your email
              address (and optional name) is sent securely to Resend in order to deliver the email.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Email provider:</strong> Incoming messages you send may be stored in my email inbox
              so I can read and reply to them.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I choose tools that offer strong security and a clear approach to privacy, and I only send
            them the minimum data necessary for their function.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Cookies and analytics</h2>
          <p>
            At this stage, The Daydreamverse Blog does not intentionally use invasive tracking cookies
            or third-party marketing trackers. If I decide to add privacy-respecting analytics in the
            future, this policy will be updated to reflect that change.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. How long data is kept</h2>
          <p>
            I keep your data only for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it
            was collected:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Newsletter data is stored while you remain subscribed.</li>
            <li>
              Contact messages are kept as long as needed to handle the conversation or for legitimate
              record-keeping.
            </li>
            <li>
              Technical logs are kept according to the retention policies of the infrastructure providers
              and for security/debugging purposes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>
          <p>
            You can unsubscribe from newsletter emails at any time using the link in the email (when
            available) or by contacting me directly and asking to be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to know what personal data I have about you in the context of this project, or
            if you want it corrected or deleted, you can reach out via the
            <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a> and I will do my best to respond within a reasonable time.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            As The Daydreamverse Blog and its infrastructure evolve, this privacy policy may change. When
            that happens, I will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page and, where
            appropriate, mention it in a blog post or newsletter.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Not legal advice</h2>
          <p>
            This privacy policy is written in clear, human language and reflects how I actually run this
            project. It is not a formal legal document and does not replace professional legal advice.
