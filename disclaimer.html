        <section>
          <h2>1. Personal experience, not professional advice</h2>
          <p>
            The Daydreamverse Blog is a personal project where I share my own experiences, reflections,
            opinions, and understanding of addiction, recovery, neurobiology, harm reduction, and related
            topics. I am not a doctor, therapist, psychologist, or medical professional.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nothing on this site should be understood as medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The
            content is not a substitute for professional medical or mental health care.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Do not ignore professional help</h2>
          <p>
            If you are struggling with addiction, mental health issues, or thoughts of self-harm or
            suicide, please seek support from qualified professionals, local health services, or trusted
            helplines in your area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Never delay seeking professional help because of something you read on this site, and never
            disregard the advice of a qualified professional based on my personal stories or opinions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Crisis situations</h2>
          <p>
            If you are in immediate danger, feel unable to keep yourself safe, or are experiencing a
            medical emergency, contact your local emergency number or crisis service right away. This
            blog cannot respond to emergencies and I cannot provide one-to-one crisis support.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Accuracy and completeness</h2>
          <p>
            I do my best to describe my experiences honestly and to base scientific explanations on
            reliable sources. However, mistakes are always possible, and knowledge evolves over time.
            The information on this site may not always be complete, up to date, or applicable to every
            situation or person.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>5. External links</h2>
          <p>
            The Daydreamverse Blog may contain links to external websites, organisations, or resources.
            These are provided for context or further reading. I do not control and am not responsible
            for the content, policies, or practices of external sites.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>6. No liability</h2>
          <p>
            By using this site, you accept that you are responsible for your own decisions. I cannot be
            held liable for any actions you take or do not take based on the content of The Daydreamverse
            Blog.

        <section>
          <h2>7. Changes to this disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            As the site grows, I may update this disclaimer to better reflect its purpose and scope.
            Changes will be noted by updating the "Last updated" date above.
