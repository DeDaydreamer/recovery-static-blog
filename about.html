        <h1>About The Daydreamverse</h1>
        <p>The Daydreamverse is a place built from recovery, curiosity, and the need to understand life beyond the surface.
It started as a private notebook I used to survive myself — a place to process addiction, trauma, fear, and the slow, painful work of rebuilding a life. Over the years it grew into something bigger: a world of thoughts, stories, and raw truths that shaped who I am today.
</p>
        <p>Here I write about the things that made me and nearly destroyed me:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>addiction and the long road back,</li>
		<li>the psychology of breaking and healing,</li>
		<li>life inside and after rehab,</li>
		<li>my perspective on the war on drugs, harm reduction, detox programs, and recovery systems around the world,</li>
		<li>and the everyday realities of living with a brain that doesn’t follow the usual script.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There’s no censorship here.
The stories are real. They happened. Some are difficult, uncomfortable, or heavy. If someone has a weak stomach or prefers clean, polished stories — this is not the place for them. I write honestly, without filters, because the truth is the only thing that ever helped me.
</p>
<h2>The Daydreamverse goes online on 20 November 2025</h2>
		<p>The Daydreamverse goes online on 20 November 2025.
From this moment I’ll start typing in everything I wrote by hand during the last three years of recovery. These notebooks hold moments, insights, failures, relapses, rebuilds, and the small victories that turned into a new life.
Texts will appear gradually. Some days I’ll publish pages from the past; other days I’ll write something new because I feel it needs to exist.
</p>
		<p>This platform is personal, but it’s not closed.
If someone needs to talk — I’m here. If someone writes to me, I will answer. Every single email. I know what loneliness in addiction feels like, and I won’t let anyone who reaches out feel ignored.
</p>
		<p>The Daydreamverse is not a self-help project.
It’s a map of a real human path: chaotic, imperfect, and honest. Maybe it helps someone find their direction. Maybe it simply shows that recovery is possible, even when it looks impossible.
</p>
		<p>If you’re here, welcome.
Walk with me through the places I’ve been — the chaos, the rebuild, the daydreams, and the truth that turned into a life worth living.
